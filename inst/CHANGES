CHANGES FROM VERSION 1.5 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  The package has been ORPHANED by the maintainer
  Alec Stephenson as of 12th July 2008. Version
  1.6 therefore has no maintainer. If you are the
  new maintainer, feel free to e-mail me with any
  questions. Good luck!

CHANGES FROM VERSION 1.4 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  The Depends field has changed: the specification 
  that R should be version 1.5.0 or later has been 
  removed (as this is a very old version anyway), 
  and the library stats (which ts is now merged 
  into) has been added. Consequently, the call to
  require in plot.potd has been deleted. 

  There were a couple of T's and F's (rather that 
  TRUE's or FALSE's) remaining from the port, as 
  identified up by the new check warnings in R-devel.
  This has now been corrected. (T or F will ordinarily
  work in R, but they can be over-written by the user, 
  and hence they should be avoided for distributed 
  code.)  

CHANGES FROM VERSION 1.3 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  The function decluster could produce incorrect
  answers if the data contained non-unique values.
  This has been fixed. The maintainer thanks 
  Diethelm Wuertz for reporting this.

  The function plot.gev produced plots with incorrect 
  residuals (uniform rather than exponential) when 
  used with the Gumbel model. This has been fixed.
  The maintainer thanks Rico Brandenburg for reporting 
  this.

CHANGES FROM VERSION 1.2 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  The "pot" class has been renamed the "potd" class
  to avoid conflict with the class of the same name
  in the R package evd.

CHANGES FROM VERSION 1.1 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  The plotting points definition for the probability
  weighted moments method of function gpd has been
  altered for consistency with quoted source. The
  maintainer thanks Michelangelo Puliga for reporting
  this.
 
  The emplot function labelled the axes incorrectly
  when alog = "y". The maintainer thanks Martin Hanek
  for reporting this.

CHANGES FROM VERSION 1.0 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  The mailing address of the maintainer has changed.

  Two codoc mismatches on default arguments fixed.
